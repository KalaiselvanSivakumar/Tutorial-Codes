Symbolic Link creation in Mac via Terminal: (Always use full path)
ln -s path_of_files path_where_link_to_create
ln -s /Volumes/OfficeWork/ZRpkgQA/qa/ ./


Error while starting a server - Server already running in the specified port:
Reason is already running process not terminated. So it is occupying the port.
Solution:
	sudo lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
	sudo kill -9 PID
Note: Replace PORT_NUMBER with your port's number (e.g. 8080) and PID with the process id (Usally chrome and java).
	   Kill both. It will result in termination of chrome. Save any unsaved work.
